# Hardware setup {#hardware_setup}

This page covers the physical setup: two projectors, one screen and one
computer. The projectors sit side by side and their images overlap in the
middle. The software blends that overlap, so the measurements taken here
have to match the values given to `SetupClass`.

Terms used below:

-   `w`: width in centimetres that one projector covers on the screen.
-   `d`: distance in centimetres between the two projectors.
-   Overlap: the part of the screen both projectors light up. Its width is
    `w - d`.
-   Side: `LEFT` or `RIGHT`, as seen from the screen.

## Equipment

| Equipment | Specification | Quantity |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Projector | TODO: model, native resolution | 2 |
| Screen | TODO: width and height in cm | 1 |
| Computer | TODO: OS, number of video outputs | 1 |
| Video cable | TODO: HDMI, DisplayPort or other | 2 |
| Stand or mount | TODO | 2 |
| Measuring tape | | 1 |

## Layout

![Projector geometry and overlap](images/projector_geometry.png)

Put both projectors at the same height and the same distance from the
screen, one on each side of its centre line. Measure the gap between them
and write it down as `d`.

Then show a test image from one projector at a time and measure its width
on the screen. That is `w`. Move the projectors or change the zoom until
the two images overlap by `w - d` centimetres and their top and bottom
edges line up.

## Connections

Plug each projector into its own video output on the computer and set the
display mode to extend, not mirror. Check that the left projector shows the
left part of the image. If the two are swapped, change the projector side
in `SetupClass`.

## Settings to match

`SetupClass` needs four values from this setup: the projector resolution,
`d`, `w`, and the side for each running instance. From these `MathClass`
works out `overlapPx`, the image regions and the mask.

## Check

Show a test image across both projectors. Look at the overlap for a bright
or dark band, and at whether straight lines break where the images meet.
If a band is visible, measure `w` and `d` again before changing `gamma`.

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Left and right halves swapped | Side set the wrong way round |
| Bright band in the overlap | `w` or `d` differs from the real layout |
| Lines step at the overlap | Projectors not level, or at different distances |
| Only one projector shows an image | Display set to mirror, or a loose cable |
